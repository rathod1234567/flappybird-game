                                                  Flappy Bird Game
 Game Setup:

A canvas is created where the game is displayed.
The bird is placed on the screen, and images for the bird and trees are loaded.
Background music starts playing when the game begins.
 Game Loop:

The game continuously updates with each frame, moving the bird and obstacles.
Gravity makes the bird fall, and pressing certain keys (like the Spacebar) makes it jump.
Trees (obstacles) move from right to left, and the player must avoid them to stay alive.
If the bird hits a tree or falls off the screen, the game ends.

 Controls:
The player can control the bird using the keyboard (Spacebar, ArrowUp, or X) or by touching the screen on mobile.
When the game ends, the player can restart it by pressing a key or touching the screen.

 Scoring:
The player earns points each time the bird successfully passes a tree.
The score is shown at the top of the screen.

Game Over:
When the bird collides with a tree or falls below the screen, a "Game Over!" message appears.
The background music stops when the game ends.

 Reset:
The game can be restarted by interacting with the canvas after a game over, resetting everything (bird position, score, obstacles).
